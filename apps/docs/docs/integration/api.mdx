# API Endpoints

## Basic

There are two endpoints which can be used to retrieve data about the running dash. instance:

### `/info`

Gives information about the static data of the running instance.
Mostly needed to read the speed-test result at `network.speedDown` and `network.speedUp`.

- Example: `https://<YOUR_SERVER_URL>/info`

### `/config`

Gives information about the configurations of the runnning instance.
Mostly needed to read the enabled widgets at `config.widget_list`,
or if multi-view for the storage widget is enabled at `config.enable_storage_split_view`.

- Example: `https://<YOUR_SERVER_URL>/config`

### `/load`

Has multiple sub-routes, each returning the current load of the given type.

- `/load/cpu`
- `/load/storage`
- `/load/ram`
- `/load/network`
- `/load/gpu`

<br />

- Example: `https://<YOUR_SERVER_URL>/load/cpu`
