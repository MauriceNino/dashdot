# Features

## `DASHDOT_PORT`

The port where the express backend is running (the backend serves the frontend, so it is the same port for both).

- type: `number`
- default: `3001`

## `DASHDOT_ROUTING_PATH`

The path where dash. is being served. This is useful if you want to run dash. behind a reverse proxy on a sub-path
(e.g `https://example.com/dashdot` would need a value of `/dashdot`).

- type: `string`
- default: `/`

## `DASHDOT_LOG_REQUESTS`

If you want to see the requests that are being made to the backend, you can enable this flag.
This is useful if you want to see if your configuration is working as expected.

- type: `boolean`
- default: `false`

## `DASHDOT_ACCEPT_OOKLA_EULA`

Use the newer and more accurate `speedtest` tool from Ookla, instead of the old `speedtest-cli` for your speedtests.
When passing this flag, you accept Ooklas: [EULA](https://www.speedtest.net/about/eula), [TERMS](https://www.speedtest.net/about/terms) and [PRIVACY](https://www.speedtest.net/about/privacy).

- type: `boolean`
- default: `false`

## `DASHDOT_USE_NETWORK_INTERFACE`

If dash. detects the wrong gateway as your default interface, you can provide a name here that is used instead.

- type: `string`
- default: `unset`

## `DASHDOT_SPEED_TEST_FROM_PATH`

You can provide a local file-path from where dash. should read its speed-test results.
This is also useful, if you want to disable speed-tests, as you can just pass a maximum value for your network graphs
and then disable the `Speed (Up)` and `Speed (Down)` labels in your network widget.

The file that is being read, should have the following format (you will need to remove the comments):

```json
{
  "unit": "byte", // can either be "bit" or "byte"
  "speedDown": 150000000, // values need to be in the unit provided above
  "speedUp": 50000000,
  "publicIp": "123.123.123.123" // optional
}
```

> Note: If you are running dash. using Docker, you will have to prepend your file path with `/mnt/host`

- type: `string`
- default: `unset`

## `DASHDOT_FS_DEVICE_FILTER`

To hide specific drives, you can pass the device names as a string list using this parameter.
If you don't know the device names of your drives, have a look at the log of dash. and look for the `Static Server Info -> storage` output.

```js
storage: {
  layout: [
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      device: 'nvme0n1',
      brand: 'Samsung',
      size: 500107862016,
      type: 'NVMe',
      raidGroup: '',
    },
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      device: 'sda',
      brand: 'DELL',
      size: 4000225165312,
      type: 'HD',
      raidGroup: '',
    },
  ];
}
```

- type: `string (comma separated list)`
- default: `unset`

## `DASHDOT_FS_TYPE_FILTER`

If dash. detects network drives as internal drives, you can provide a list of ignored FS types here.
Please also create a [bug ticket](https://github.com/MauriceNino/dashdot/issues/new/choose) on the
repository though, so that we can fix this problem for everyone.

- type: `string (comma separated list)`
- default: `cifs,9p,fuse.rclone,fuse.mergerfs,nfs4,iso9660,fuse.shfs`

## `DASHDOT_FS_VIRTUAL_MOUNTS`

If you want to show a virtual mount in the storage split view, that is ignored in the filter above.
Can be used for example to show `fuse.mergerfs` mounts, which is basically a grouping of other mounts.

You need to pass the names of the filesystems you want to use. To find out what the name is, execute `df`
and look at the first column.

Note that this will only be shown in the storage split view. The normal pie chart will not be affected
and there will also be no disk shown in the list of the storage widget.

- type: `string (comma separated list)`
- default: `unset`

## `DASHDOT_DISABLE_INTEGRATIONS`

Disables support for integrations. This does two things: disable CORS and disable open API endpoints.

- type: `boolean`
- default: `false`
