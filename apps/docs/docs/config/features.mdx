# Features

## `DASHDOT_PORT`

The port where the express backend is running (the backend serves the frontend, so it is the same port for both).

- type: `number`
- default: `3001`

## `DASHDOT_ACCEPT_OOKLA_EULA`

Use the newer and more accurate `speedtest` tool from Ookla, instead of the old `speedtest-cli` for your speedtests.
When passing this flag, you accept Ooklas: [EULA](https://www.speedtest.net/about/eula), [TERMS](https://www.speedtest.net/about/terms) and [PRIVACY](https://www.speedtest.net/about/privacy).

- type: `boolean`
- default: `false`

## `DASHDOT_USE_NETWORK_INTERFACE`

If dash. detects the wrong gateway as your default interface, you can provide a name here that is used instead.

- type: `string`
- default: `unset`

## `DASHDOT_FS_DEVICE_FILTER`

To hide specific drives, you can pass the device names as a string list using this parameter.
If you don't know the device names of your drives, have a look at the log of dash. and look for the `Static Server Info -> storage` output.

```js
storage: {
  layout: [
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      device: 'nvme0n1',
      brand: 'Samsung',
      size: 500107862016,
      type: 'NVMe',
      raidGroup: '',
    },
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      device: 'sda',
      brand: 'DELL',
      size: 4000225165312,
      type: 'HD',
      raidGroup: '',
    },
  ];
}
```

- type: `string (comma separated list)`
- default: `unset`

## `DASHDOT_FS_TYPE_FILTER`

If dash. detects network drives as internal drives, you can provide a list of ignored FS types here.
Please also create a [bug ticket](https://github.com/MauriceNino/dashdot/issues/new/choose) on the
repository though, so that we can fix this problem for everyone.

- type: `string (comma separated list)`
- default: `cifs,9p,fuse.rclone,fuse.mergerfs,nfs4`

## `DASHDOT_FS_VIRTUAL_MOUNTS`

If you want to show a virtual mount in the storage split view, that is ignored in the filter above.
Can be used for example to show `fuse.mergerfs` mounts, which is basically a grouping of other mounts.

You need to pass the names of the filesystems you want to use. To find out what the name is, execute `df`
and look at the first column.

Note that this will only be shown in the storage split view (enabled with the
[`DASHDOT_ENABLE_STORAGE_SPLIT_VIEW`](./config#dashdot_enable_storage_split_view) flag).
The normal pie chart will not be affected and there will also be no disk shown in the list of the storage
widget.

- type: `string (comma separated list)`
- default: `unset`

## `DASHDOT_DISABLE_INTEGRATIONS`

Disables support for integrations. This does two things: disable CORS and disable open API endpoints.

- type: `boolean`
- default: `false`
