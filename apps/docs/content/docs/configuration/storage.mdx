## Options

### `DASHDOT_STORAGE_LABEL_LIST`

Selects which data is shown in the storage widget.

The available options are: `brand`, `size`, `type`.

- type: `string (comma separated list)`
- default: `brand,size,type`

### `DASHDOT_FS_DEVICE_FILTER`

To hide specific drives, you can pass the device names as a string list using this parameter.
If you don't know the device names of your drives, have a look at the log of dash. and look for the `Static Server Info -> storage` output.

```js
storage: {
  layout: [
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      device: 'nvme0n1',
      brand: 'Samsung',
      size: 500107862016,
      type: 'NVMe',
      raidGroup: '',
    },
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      device: 'sda',
      brand: 'DELL',
      size: 4000225165312,
      type: 'HD',
      raidGroup: '',
    },
  ];
}
```

- type: `string (comma separated list)`
- default: `unset`

### `DASHDOT_FS_TYPE_FILTER`

If dash. detects network drives as internal drives, you can provide a list of ignored FS types here.
Please also create a [bug ticket](https://github.com/MauriceNino/dashdot/issues/new/choose) on the
repository though, so that we can fix this problem for everyone.

- type: `string (comma separated list)`
- default: `cifs,9p,fuse.rclone,fuse.mergerfs,nfs4,iso9660,fuse.shfs,autofs`

### `DASHDOT_FS_VIRTUAL_MOUNTS`

If you want to show a virtual mount in the storage split view, that is ignored in the filter above.
Can be used for example to show `fuse.mergerfs` mounts, which is basically a grouping of other mounts.

You need to pass the names of the filesystems you want to use. To find out what the name is, execute `df`
and look at the first column.

Note that this will only be shown in the storage split view. The normal pie chart will not be affected
and there will also be no disk shown in the list of the storage widget.

- type: `string (comma separated list)`
- default: `unset`

## Styles

### `DASHDOT_STORAGE_WIDGET_ITEMS_PER_PAGE`

To adjust the number of items per page in the Storage view, when multiple disks are
present.

- type: `number`
- default: `3`

### `DASHDOT_STORAGE_WIDGET_GROW`

To adjust the relative size of the Storage widget.

- type: `number`
- default: `3.5`

### `DASHDOT_STORAGE_WIDGET_MIN_WIDTH`

To adjust the minimum width of the Storage widget (in px).

- type: `number`
- default: `500`

### `DASHDOT_STORAGE_POLL_INTERVAL`

Read the Storage load every x milliseconds.

- type: `number`
- default: `60000`

## Overrides

You can use overrides to manually set statically gathered data. This is useful
if you want to use dashdot on a VPS or a system where the data cannot be
gathered automatically.

### `DASHDOT_OVERRIDE_STORAGE_BRANDS`

Pass a list of key-value pairs where the key is the device name of your drive (have a look in the log in `Static Server Info` > `storage` to gather the device name) and the value is the new brand of the device. An example value could be `sda=Samsung,sdb=Western Digital`.

- type: `string`
- default: `unset`

### `DASHDOT_OVERRIDE_STORAGE_SIZES`

Pass a list of key-value pairs where the key is the device name of your drive (have a look in the log in `Static Server Info` > `storage` to gather the device name) and the value is the new size of the device (In RAIDS you only need to apply this to a single drive in the RAID). An example value could be `sda=56127367,sdb=6172637222`.
Number needs to be passed in bytes (e.g. `34359738368` for 32 GB, because it is `32 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024`).

- type: `string`
- default: `unset`

### `DASHDOT_OVERRIDE_STORAGE_TYPES`

Pass a list of key-value pairs where the key is the device name of your drive (have a look in the log in `Static Server Info` > `storage` to gather the device name) and the value is the new type of the device. An example value could be `sda=SSD,sdb=HDD`.

- type: `string`
- default: `unset`
