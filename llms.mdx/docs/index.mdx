What is Dash.? [#what-is-dash]

At its core, Dashdot is a monitoring tool that gathers system information and presents
it through a beautiful, reactive web interface.
Whether you are running a small Raspberry Pi homelab or a beefy dedicated root server,
Dashdot gives you an instant overview of:

* **CPU:** Usage, model, and core-specific performance.
* **Memory:** Real-time RAM utilization.
* **Storage:** Disk space across all mounted drives.
* **Network:** Up/Down speeds and total data transferred.
* **GPU:** Support for monitoring modern graphics cards (only NVIDIA via Docker).

Configuration [#configuration]

Dashdot is designed to be highly plug-and-play, but it offers extensive customization via **Environment Variables**.
These allow you to tweak the behavior and appearance without touching the source code.

You can find more details on how to set these variables in our [Configuration Section](docs/configuration).
